<b>Content management system for news.byu.edu</b>
    
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of NewsNow is to automate the production of content by the staff of University Communications for consumption by the digital media and to make the use of technology by UC staff easy and pleasant. We accomplish this by:<br />
<ul>•  Using a database for text and images that can easily produce web services<br />
  •  Providing a forms-based content management system that allows staff members to:
<ul>    o	create news releases that include text, photos, video, hyperlinks, credits, social media links, highlights, related stories, date, categories, and contact information<br />
    o	manipulate the main news page to choose what appears and in what order<br />
    o	manipulate a features page in the same way<br />
    o	maintain an address book<br />
    o	assemble and mail the YNews<br />
    o	find and use resources on Unicomm<br />
    o	maintain Y Facts</ul></ul></p>
<p>Purpose of This Project:</p>
<p>Migrate the existing NewsNow to a Drupal 7 system on the Typo server, preserving its current features as specified in the Deliverables and bringing the design into compliance with the university templates.</p>
